## Summary

Following the Pluralsight course [*Android Apps with Kotlin: Build Your First App*](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/a2bc183f-8bd2-4365-9e82-2cd7afc997ce/table-of-contents)

## Aims

* Practice building a working Android app using Kotlin
* Stretch goal - start building a different app to the one described in the course

## Troubleshooting

If at any point your app does not work, check for differences in the example exercise files from Pluralsight, which are available for [download](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/android-apps-kotlin-build-first-app/exercise-files).

## Known course issues

Creating a basic android activity now, versus when the time at which the course author did so, creates android fragments by default. Fragments require a different setup to the one shown in the course, therefore I removed the fragments.
